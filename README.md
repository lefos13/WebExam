# WebExam

This Project is a web exam project that i was assigned to do durring a course in my University. It includes a Web REST API, Json objects, Bootstrap, Ajax, Java, a MySQL database, administration system with a Swing app.

WebDiktiakos is the actual web app.
Service is the web API.
MyDesktop is the Swing app.

This Project has been made with no prior knowledge of modern frameworks or architectures. It was just just a big project that made me understand and gain some experience with some concepts that were completely unknown to me at that time.
